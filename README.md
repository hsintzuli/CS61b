# CS61B - Learning Note
  **CS61B 學習筆記**
  
  This project documents the code for the Autograde of CS61B-sp18. All of the labs, exercises and projects would be covered.
  The lecture code are also included in the lectures folder but just for the records of self practicing. 
  Before taking the midterms, I would orginize the contents and notes as a way to prepare the exam and upload the notes in my website.
